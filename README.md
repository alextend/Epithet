# Epithet

Every title you've earned, in one hall of names.

Epithet is a collections add-on for the one reward World of Warcraft never gave a proper home: your titles. the Astral Walker. Hand of A'dal. Scarab Lord. Each one is a story, a raid cleared, a grind survived, a moment that mattered. Epithet gathers them into a single calm, scholarly journal so you can browse, filter, and equip any title in two clicks, without digging through menus or fumbling slash commands (although we do have slash commands if that's your thing).

It looks and feels (hopefully) like a quiet hall of heraldry, built for prestige rather than flash.

## Features

### Title Browser

- **Full title catalogue** - enumerates all titles via the client API, joined with a curated static database containing source info, expansion, and rarity.
- **Rarity tiers** - colour-coded Common → Legendary, displayed in standard WoW item-quality colours, with an in-app popup explaining how the percentages are estimated.
- **Collection tracking** - earned vs unearned at a glance, with a collected count (optionally scoped to obtainable-only titles).
- **Filters** - by expansion, status (earned/unearned), rarity, type, category, prefix/suffix, faction, favourites-only, hide-unobtainable, hide-time-sensitive, and free-text search.
- **Favourites** - star any earned title; favourites pin to the top of the Collected group in "Collected First" sort mode and show a star prefix in the list.
- **Set title** - "Set as My Title" button wired to a hardware event (required by the protected `SetCurrentTitle` API).
- **About modal** - addon and author info from a title-bar info button.

### Title Spotting (Social Layer)

- **Target nameplate overlay** - shows the title currently displayed by whoever you're targeting, anchored below the Blizzard target frame.
- **Two layouts** - "Slimline" (classic) and "Portrait Card", with an optional animated 3D portrait, configurable fade-out on target loss, and a draggable/lockable position.
- **Visibility rules** - optional auto-hide in combat or in a group, so the overlay stays out of the way when it isn't wanted.
- **Spotting Log** - a persistent, per-character log of titles you've spotted on other players, with list/grid views and scope toggle (spotted vs. remaining), plus import/export for sharing logs.
- **Epithet Achievements** - a dedicated achievement system built on top of spotting and collection data: progression tiers, coverage goals, crossover and secret achievements, earned-record persistence, and optional chat notifications. Opened from its own header button, separate from the Spotting Log.

### Quality of Life

- **What's New popup** - a themed, version-mapped changelog dialog shown once per update; reopen anytime with `/epithet whatsnew`.
- **Minimap button** - via LibDataBroker/LibDBIcon, with a tooltip showing your current collected count; toggle with `/epithet minimap`.
- **Slash commands** - `/epithet` (or `/titles`) toggles the browser window; see [Usage In-Game](#usage-in-game) for the full list.

## API Research (Warcraft Wiki - confirmed 12.0.1 mainline)

| Function                   | Signature                                   | Notes                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GetNumTitles()`           | `numTitles = GetNumTitles()`                | Returns the **highest** title ID (sparse - gaps exist)              |
| `GetTitleName(titleId)`    | `name, playerTitle = GetTitleName(titleId)` | Trailing space in `name` → prefix; otherwise suffix                 |
| `IsTitleKnown(titleId)`    | `isKnown = IsTitleKnown(titleId)`           | Boolean - the character has earned it                               |
| `GetCurrentTitle()`        | `currentTitle = GetCurrentTitle()`          | Returns active title ID (0 = none)                                  |
| `SetCurrentTitle(titleId)` | `SetCurrentTitle(titleId)`                  | **Protected** - must originate from a hardware event (button click) |

The API exposes **only** the title list and known/unknown state. It does **not** provide rarity or source - hence the static data table.

## Rarity Heuristic

Since no authoritative rarity feed exists, rarity is derived from acquisition category:

| Tier | Label     | Criteria                                                                            |
| ---- | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5    | Legendary | Seasonal PvP Glad/R1/Hero, Grand Marshal/High Warlord, Scarab Lord                  |
| 4    | Epic      | Removed/unobtainable, Challenge Mode Gold, Hall of Fame, Cutting Edge, "the Insane" |
| 3    | Rare      | Multi-patch meta-achievements (Loremaster, Glory metas), M+ score titles            |
| 2    | Uncommon  | Single achievements, holiday metas, campaign completion, exploration                |
| 1    | Common    | Baseline rep grinds, low PvP ranks, trivial quest rewards                           |

Override any title by adding its ID to `RARITY_OVERRIDES` in `tools/generate-titles.js`.
